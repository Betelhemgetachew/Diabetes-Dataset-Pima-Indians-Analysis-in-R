## Diabetes Dataset-Pima Indians Analysis
### About the Project
This project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to predict diabetes diagnosis based on various diagnostic measurements. The dataset comprises female patients aged 21 and older of Pima Indian heritage, featuring several independent medical predictor variables and a single dependent variable (Outcome).

### Dataset Attributes
- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.  
- Glucose: Blood glucose level.  
- Blood Pressure: Blood pressure measurement.  
- Skin Thickness: Thickness of skin.  
- Insulin: Blood insulin level.  
- BMI: Body mass index.  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function: Genetic likelihood of diabetes.  
- Age: Age of the patient.  
- Outcome: Diagnosis result (1 indicates diabetes, 0 indicates no diabetes).  
### Objective
The objective of this project is to explore the dataset and build predictive models to determine the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on the provided attributes.
